<h2>SETUP</h2>
    <p> This is a two player game that consist of a deck of 52 cards. The deck will shuffle itself then give each player 26 cards. The cards will be face down the entire time. There will be a scoreboard to keep track how many cards each player has left.The use of JavaScript will be used to make the game playable while using HTML to organize the elements on the page and CSS to make the game appealing.<p>

<h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
   <div> 1) Both players flip their card on top. </div>
    <div>2) The player who flipped the higher a card wins both cards which is then added to thier deck.<div>
    <div>3) This process is repeated until both players flip a card that have the same card, therefore WAR is initiated. </div>
    <div>4) Once war is initiated both players take 4 more additional cards from their deck while the cards are still face down.</div>
    <div>5) The 4th card that is taken out is then flipped.
    <div>6) Whichever player has the highest card wins all cards that have been played during this turn.</div>
    <div>7) However if both players flip a card that have the same card, repeat steps 4-6 until one player flips a card higher than the other player.</div>
    <div>8) WAR will end then the game will resume normally until both players flip the same card which then war will re-initiate once again and this process will repeat until one player gains 52 cards.</div>

<h2>WINNER</h2>
  <p>Normally the winner would be declared whenever one player has a score of 52 but to not let the game run on forever there is a winner button that declares who is the winner.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p> In the future I will incorporate less cards so the game can actually be played in its entirety so the winner button won't have to be ceated. I will incorporate CSS to make the cards flip and to include a delay timer so player one flips card then a few seconds later the computer flips its card during normal and war rounds.</p>
